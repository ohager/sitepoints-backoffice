__Note__: This project is still in construction - The build environment is still unstable.


## Introduction

This project demonstrates a backoffice use case for the Sitepoints project (https://github.com/ohager/sitepoints).
The idea is offer administrative control over stored sitepoints data accumulated by the user.

To run this project you need to clone the Sitepoints project also, which offers the necessary backend and rest api.
Accumulate data with the Sitepoints client (https://github.com/ohager/sitepoint-client).
